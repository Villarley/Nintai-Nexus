# Repository Rules

## Contributions

1. **Pull Requests**: All changes must be made through Pull Requests (PR).
2. **Code Review**: All PRs must be reviewed by at least one collaborator before merging.
3. **CamelCase Usage**: Use CamelCase for coding standards.
4. **File and Component Naming**: Name files and components in uppercase.
5. **Code Indentation**: Ensure proper indentation in the codebase. Use the standard of VSCode. "ctrl + p" + "Format Document"

## Branching Strategy

1. **Main and Develop Branches**: Never work directly on the `main` or `develop` branches. Always create feature branches for development.
